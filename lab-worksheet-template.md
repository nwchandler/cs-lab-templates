## Goal
_Describe your learning objective for the lab. What do you want to learn or how do you want to grow by doing this? When you find yourself going down rabbit holes that do not relate to this goal, make a note in "Follow-Up Threads."_

## Key Questions
_List 1-3 targeted questions to answer by the end of this session in support of your Goal. These can be lower-order (mechanical: "What happens when..."), mid-order (integrative: "How does X affect Y"), and higher-order (evaluative: "How important is X compared to Y")._

## Lab Description
_Briefly summarize what you expect to accomplish or produce in this lab. Link it to your Goal and Key Questions._

## Time Box
_How long do you think this session will take? How long will you give yourself for this session?_

## Setup / Context (_optional_)
_List relevant environment information (branch / commit, OS, build information, etc.), tools you'll need, etc. Only needed when this type of information will help to get the lab started more quickly when it's time to start or when reproducibility is important._

---
## Micro-Experiments
_These are small, focused probes done during the session, in support of the Goal or Key Questions. Insert as many copies of Lab Micro-Experiment Template as needed._

---
## Follow-Up Threads
_What threads did you find during this experience that seem like they are worth pulling on in the future, either in lab or study sessions? These are technical lines of inquiry._

## Reflection Seeds
_Surprises or patterns you noticed in how you worked that are worth deeper reflection using, e.g., Gibb's or Kolb's. These are process lines of inquiry._
