# Computer Science Lab Notes Template

This template helps you learn computer science topics via deliberate experimentation. It provides structure to track what happens during lab sessions and convert those results into lasting learning.

It guides structured, hands-on lab work across CS domains, from systems programming to algorithms, networking, compilers, or other technical topics. The template helps you connect experiments to learning goals, capture insights, and reflect on both technical outcomes and your learning process.

The templates are standard Markdown-formatted files, and they should work seamlessly in your favorite editor. Just clone the repo or copy the files, and then use them with whatever tooling you prefer. (For reference, I personally use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for this.)

## How to Use the Lab Worksheet Template

The [Lab Worksheet Template](lab-worksheet-template.md) is divided into three sections: Before, During, and After the lab session.

1. **Before the Lab**

   - **Goal**: Define what you want to learn or the skill you want to grow.
   - **Key Questions**: List 1-3 questions you hope to answer. Relate these to your Goal.
   - **Lab Description**: State the technical result or tangible output you expect. Relate it to your Goal and Key Questions.
   - **Time Box**: Estimate the session duration.
   - **Setup / Context (optional)**: Note environment, tools, branches, commits, or other reproducibility information.

2. **During the Lab**

   - Fill out **Micro-Experiments** as you progress. Insert from the [Lab Micro-Experiment Template](lab-micro-experiment-template.md) as many times as you need. Each should include:
     - **ID**: A brief descriptive identifier for the experiment.
     - **Hypothesis**: What you expect to happen and why.
     - **Reality**: What actually happened.
     - **Debugging Trail (optional)**: Steps, dead ends, or failed hypotheses while resolving discrepancies.
     - **Lesson / Takeaway**: What you learned, and how you will update your mental model or practice.

3. **After the Lab** \*

- **Follow-Up Threads**: Capture technical tangents or promising ideas to explore in future labs or study sessions.
- **Reflection Seeds**: Note surprises, patterns, or workflow observations worth deeper reflection and self-assessment.

* _NOTE_: Because our memory tends to fade quickly, you should fill out the after-lab sections as soon as possible following the session. You can process them later, but be sure to make some brief notes while they are fresh on your mind.

## Benefits

- Promotes **structured learning** by linking goals, questions, and experiments.
- Encourages **iterative experimentation**, hypothesis testing, and observation.
- Captures both **technical insights** and **meta-cognitive reflections**, supporting long-term understanding.
- Flexible for use in any computer science domain with lab-style or project-based practice.
